                <h1>Hi, I'm Brock!</h1>
                <p>I hope you enjoy perusing my meanderings. I've wanted to learn how to code and design websites for my whole adult life.
                    Now that I've finally learned how, this process is becoming a way for me to appreciate the journey of learning and growing a skillset.
                    As a life-long musician who has been plotting to release a full-length music album since 15 years old, I know a thing or two about the
                    dangers of perfectionism (AKA, never releasing the product because it isn't "done" yet.) Spoiler alert: the thing will never be "done."
                 </p><br>
                 <p>Please assist me in my battle against the evils of perfectionism by checking out my whole site. You will learn about me, my talents
                    and abilities, as well as my aspirations. If you haven't already noticed, there is a special treat for your ears if you click a 
                    certain link on the homepage (not functional yet.) Have fun!
                 </p>
